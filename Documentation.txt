### **Introduction**###

File management can quickly become a hassle when different types of files—documents, images, videos, music, and more—pile up in the default "Downloads" folder. Without proper organization, it becomes difficult to locate files or maintain a structured system. This script offers an automated solution by categorizing downloaded files based on their file type and moving them into predefined folders such as Documents, Videos, Music, etc. By leveraging Python and the `watchdog` library, this program continuously monitors the Downloads folder and organizes files in real time.



### **Objectives**###

The main objectives of this program are:
1. **Automated Sorting**: Automatically detect newly downloaded files and sort them based on their file extensions.
2. **Custom Folder Creation**: Create specific folders (Documents, Images, Videos, etc.) if they don’t exist and move files accordingly.
3. **Enhanced Organization**: Ensure that files of different types (e.g., `.pdf`, `.jpg`, `.mp4`, `.exe`, `.java`, etc.) are categorized into respective folders, minimizing manual effort.
4. **Real-Time Monitoring**: Continuously monitor the Downloads folder for changes and sort files as they are added or modified.



### **Program**###

The program utilizes Python to monitor the Downloads folder and automatically moves files into respective folders based on their type. Here's the code:



### **Explanation**###

#### **1. Libraries and Imports:**###
- **os**: Used to interact with the operating system, such as file and folder paths.
- **shutil**: This is used to move files from one directory to another.
- **watchdog**: A library that monitors file system changes, allowing the program to respond when new files are added to the Downloads folder.

#### **2. Folder Definitions (`TARGET_DIRS`):**
The `TARGET_DIRS` dictionary is the core of the file classification system. Each key represents a folder name, and its value is a list of file extensions that should be moved into that folder. For example:
- Files with `.pdf`, `.docx`, `.txt`, `.xls`, and `.xlsx` extensions are moved to the **Documents** folder.
- Files with `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.gif` are moved to the **Images** folder.
- Code files like `.java`, `.py`, and `.cs` are moved into the **Code** folder.
  
This allows for easy customization and scalability, enabling users to add new file types and target directories as needed.

#### **3. Event Handling (`DownloadHandler` Class):**
The `DownloadHandler` class extends the `FileSystemEventHandler` from the `watchdog` library. It listens for file changes in the Downloads folder through the `on_modified` method. Once triggered, the method checks for newly added or modified files, and based on their extension, it moves them into the appropriate folder using the `move_file_to_folder` function.

#### **4. File Movement (`move_file_to_folder` Function):**
This function checks if the destination folder exists. If it doesn’t, it creates the folder. Then it moves the file into the specified folder, logging the result (success or failure) to the console.



#### **5. Main Program:**###
The program sets up an observer that watches the Downloads folder and assigns the `DownloadHandler` event handler to it. The observer is kept running indefinitely unless interrupted by a `KeyboardInterrupt` (e.g., pressing `Ctrl + C`), at which point it stops and waits for all events to finish processing.



### **Conclusion**###
This Python-based solution automates file organization within the Downloads folder, significantly reducing manual effort. By monitoring the folder in real time, the program dynamically sorts files into predefined categories like Documents, Images, Videos, and more, while allowing easy customization for new file types. This solution not only improves the organization but also ensures files are easy to find, streamlining the user's workflow and enhancing productivity. 
By extending or modifying the `TARGET_DIRS` dictionary, this script can be adapted to suit specific use cases, making it a flexible tool for file management.
